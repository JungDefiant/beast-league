# CF201-Final-Project

## Final Project for Code Fellows 201 class D-62

Team Name: Monsters Inc.

Two options for project:
- A pokemon like rpg game that is turn based, where you get a random monster, choose it's name, and fight against others. This would include make constructors for things like the monsters, with methods for things like attacking, choosing randoms for battle, a turn manager to control what monsters spawn, who's turn it is, etc. Pokemon is a hugely popular game series, beloved by many, and the format has become almost ubiquitous for many similarly styled games. We plan to create a new, stripped down version of this format in a browser that has the functionality of Pokemon battles, without the pain of needing to buy a Switch. Our minimum MVP is to have 5 different monsters, each with two abilities and a set HP, three round sets, you pick one monster and battle through three opponents, displaying a score at the end which takes how many HP the player lost and how much damage they inflicted into account.

- A puzzle RPG where you play Snake to control a turn based RPG battle. The user would see two different sections of the game, one being on top being the RPG with a character being shown battling opponents, the bottom would be a game of snake, where the user is collecting pellets in order to power up and fuel the battle occuring above. The aim of this product is to capitalize on a market of people who enjoy games like Snake, simple and old-school, but also are drawn in by the animations and the feeling that it is something bigger than a simple game of Snake, this will both hook players quickly with a familiar game format, as well and draw them in long-term by expanding upon an already well loved property. This would mean the top screen is sort of an animation based on what's happening in the snake game below. Our minimum MVP for this project would be a very basic snake game and a very basic animation to go along with it, one character shown above fighting through 2 or 3 different monsters, with a snake game including randomly colored dots below.
