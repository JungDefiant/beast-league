    <p class='howToPHead'>Advanced Rules:</p>
    <li>Base stat levels range from 25 to 35. All monsters have a distributed 90 stat points.</li>
    <li>Attack will increase the damage each attack does, defense will decrease incoming damage, and speed will affect who goes first each turn.</li>
    <li>An execution roll is done for each effect of an ability, this roll will determine whether the effect lands on the enemy.</li>
    <li>For damage, a base damage is set for each attack and a random roll is done to give 50 - 150% of the base damage value, this is multiplied by the user's attack value divided by the target's defense, and then applied accordingly.</li>
    <li>Some attacks will inflict damage effects such as stun, DoTs, poison, stat buffs/debuffs and more.</li>
