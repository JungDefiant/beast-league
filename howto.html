      <li>When the game starts your monster will appear on the left, the enemy will apear on the right of the screen.</li>
      <li>You and the computer will take turns using abilities against each other.</li>
      <li>Each monster has two abilities. These are shown beneath your monster, press the key corresponding to the ability you want to use this turn.</li>
      <li>The fight will progress until one monster is left standing, their health is indicated by the bar and number above their head.</li>
    </ul>

  <ul class='howToList howToAdvanced'>
    <p class='howToPHead'>Advanced Rules:</p>
    <li>Base stats range from 25 to 35 for each stat. All monsters have a distributed 90 stat points.</li>
    <li>Attack will increase the damage each attack does, defense will decrease incoming damage, and speed will affect who goes first each turn.</li>
    <li>An execution roll is done for each effect of an ability, this roll will determine whether the effect lands on the enemy.</li>
    <li>For damage, a base damage is set for each attack and a roll is done to give 50 - 150% of the base damage value, this is multiplied by the user's attack value divided by the target's defense and then applied accordingly.</li>
    <li>Some attacks will inflict damage effects such as stun, DoTs, poison, stat buffs/debuffs and more.</li>
