    <p class='gameBio'>Hello all, and thank you so much for visiting our site. This webpage, and the included game, were created for a final project for Code Fellows course 201 by three students: Bade Habib, Ryan Creamer and Nicco Ryan, please see below for a bit more about each of us! The game was inspired by classic Pokemon titles, something each of the members in this group have a profound respect and admiration for. We decided we would try to recapture the spirit of these early games, with our own special twist. The idea to incorporate mythological and fantastical beasts from all different times and cultures came early in the creation of this project, Genrath was our first, and the others just flowed forth after that. The project was a learning experience for all of us, learning to write code as a group and ensuring that all of our work would line up together was no trivial task, everyone writes code a bit differently, so finding those differences and doing our best to bring them in line with each other was crucial. It wasn't all trials and tribulations though, the MVP for the project came together a lot quicker than we expected, and I think we all learned a good bit about team work and coding as a group, which is invaluable experience. We're satisfied with how this game turned and we hope that you are too, thank you again for visiting.</p>

        <p class='bioBlock'>I'm a Navy veteran with 2-1/2 years of C# and Unity experience. My time in the Navy was spent doing server administration and then later penetration testing. After leaving the Navy, I dedicated two years to earn a General associate's degree with a focus in Psychology. My next step is to pursue a career as a software developer, preferably with a company or industry dedicated to social change.</p>

        <p class='bioBlock' id = 'ryanBio'>I am a 20 year old, from Puyallup Washington. I have always loved to play video games and just tech in gerneal, i also like to make things and see how they come together, so i thought software development would be a perfect fit. I was unsure of where to go to learn, but my girlfriends brother has been in the tech industry for many years now and he recomended me to codefellows so I can be job ready.</p>

        <p class='bioBlock'>I have had a passion for coding for years now, I took a few computer science classes and learned data management with Python and Matlab while at University of Oregon while completing a degree in Earth Sciences and continued coding afterwards as a hobby making games and sophisticated data visualizations. I am transitioning into a career in Software Development currently and this is one of the stepping stones on that journey. For this project I helmed quite a bit of the styling of the website, how all the pages including the game screen were laid out and had a hand in many of the battle elements including monster creation and implementing new abilties and effects into the code. I feel that I learned a lot during this project, I learned how to work in a group setting much better, how to read code other people have written and understand it much better, and my personal shortcomings in writing understandable and compatible code with a team, which I've become much better at throughout this process.</p>
